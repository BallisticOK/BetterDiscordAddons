# Discontinued

Due to complexity and time constraints, this plugin is discontinued. You can emulate this plugin's functionality by using the built-in quick swticher (`ctrl`+`k`) and starting your search with a `*` to limit it to servers. Developers that would like to pick up where this left off are free to do so.
